# Contributing to O.A.S.I.S. Simulation Framework


Thank you for your interest in contributing to O.A.S.I.S. Simulation Framework!

This guide explains our contribution workflow, conventions, and review process.

---

## Before You Start

### Understanding Our Workflow

We use a **fork-first workflow**. This means:
- You work on your own copy (fork) of the repository
- Changes are proposed via Pull Requests from your fork
- This keeps the main repository clean and secure

### Why Fork-First?

1. **Security**: Only maintainers have write access to the main repo
2. **Experimentation**: You can freely experiment in your fork
3. **Learning**: Great practice for contributing to any open source project
4. **Backup**: Your fork serves as a backup of your work

---

## Fork-First Workflow

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Click the "Fork" button on the repository page
2. This creates your personal copy at `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/the-oasis-project-simulation-repo`

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork

```bash
# Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/the-oasis-project-simulation-repo.git
cd the-oasis-project-simulation-repo

# Add the original repo as "upstream" for syncing
git remote add upstream https://github.com/malcolmhoward/the-oasis-project-simulation-repo.git
```

### Step 3: Keep Your Fork Updated

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge upstream main into your local main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Create a Feature Branch

**Never work directly on `main`**. Always create a branch:

```bash
git checkout -b type/description
```

---

## Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:

```
type/short-description
```

### Branch Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `feat/` | New feature | `feat/user-authentication` |
| `fix/` | Bug fix | `fix/login-validation` |
| `docs/` | Documentation only | `docs/api-examples` |
| `refactor/` | Code restructuring | `refactor/database-layer` |
| `test/` | Adding/updating tests | `test/auth-unit-tests` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance tasks | `chore/update-dependencies` |

### Good Branch Names
- `feat/add-dark-mode`
- `fix/memory-leak-on-upload`
- `docs/installation-guide`

### Avoid
- `my-changes` (not descriptive)
- `fix` (too vague)
- `john-branch` (personal names)

---

## Conventional Commits

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for clear, consistent history.

### Format

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Commit Types

| Type | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | Adding new functionality |
| `fix` | Fixing a bug |
| `docs` | Documentation changes only |
| `style` | Formatting (no code logic change) |
| `refactor` | Restructuring without behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance (dependencies, configs) |

### Examples

```bash
# Feature
git commit -m "feat(auth): add password reset flow"

# Bug fix
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null response from server"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs(readme): add installation instructions"

# Breaking change (note the !)
git commit -m "feat(api)!: change authentication endpoint"
```

### Why Conventional Commits?

1. **Automatic changelogs**: Tools can generate release notes
2. **Clear history**: Easy to understand what changed and why
3. **Semantic versioning**: Commit types inform version bumps
4. **Better reviews**: Reviewers understand intent quickly

## Suggesting Features

### Before Proposing

1. **Search existing issues** - your idea may already be discussed
2. **Check the roadmap** - it might be planned already
3. **Consider scope** - does it fit the project's goals?

### Priority Assessment

When proposing features, consider these factors:

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| **Impact** | How many users benefit? How significant is the improvement? |
| **Effort** | How complex is implementation? What's the maintenance burden? |
| **Risk** | What could break? Are there security implications? |
| **Alignment** | Does it fit project goals and architecture? |

### Feature Request Template

```markdown
## Problem Statement
What problem does this solve?

## Proposed Solution
How should it work?

## Alternatives Considered
What other approaches exist?

## Priority Assessment
- Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
- Effort: [High/Medium/Low]
- Risk: [High/Medium/Low]
```

---

## Code Review Process

### What Reviewers Look For

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it claims?
2. **Tests**: Are changes covered by tests?
3. **Style**: Does it follow project conventions?
4. **Documentation**: Are changes documented?
5. **Security**: Are there any vulnerabilities?
6. **Performance**: Any performance implications?

### Educational Review Criteria

We review with education in mind:

| Criteria | What We Check |
|----------|---------------|
| **Clarity** | Is the code readable and self-documenting? |
| **Simplicity** | Is this the simplest solution that works? |
| **Maintainability** | Will future contributors understand this? |
| **Best Practices** | Does it follow established patterns? |

### Responding to Feedback

- **Be open**: Feedback improves code quality
- **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, ask
- **Iterate**: Multiple rounds of review are normal
- **Learn**: Each review is a learning opportunity

---

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) style conventions
- Write clear, self-documenting code; add comments only where logic is non-obvious
- Keep functions focused and small
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase

### HAL-First Development Pattern

The simulation framework uses a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to separate
interface contracts from implementations. **Every mock class must implement an
ABC (Abstract Base Class) defined in `simulation/hal/`.**

When adding a new mock class:

1. **Define the interface first** — add an ABC in the appropriate HAL module
   (`simulation/hal/device.py`, `network.py`, or `platform.py`)
2. **Commit the interface** before writing the implementation
3. **Implement the mock** by subclassing the HAL ABC

This order matters in both the code and the git history. The interface commit
should always precede the implementation commit so that reviewers can evaluate
the contract before the details.

### Layer Isolation

The simulation layers and HAL have a strict dependency rule:

- **HAL** (`hal/`) must not import from any `layer` module
- **Device layer** (`layer0/`) may import from `hal/` only
- **Network layer** (`layer1/`) may import from `hal/` and `layer0/`
- **Platform layer** (`layer2/`) may import from `hal/`, `layer0/`, and `layer1/`

This is enforced structurally — a breaking change in the Platform layer must not affect the Device or Network layers.

### Interface Compatibility

Mock classes must implement their corresponding HAL ABC and be
interface-compatible with their real hardware or service counterparts. This is
what enables selective injection — the same component code runs against a real
driver or a mock without modification. If you add a new method to a mock class,
add it to the HAL ABC first, then implement it.

### Testing Requirements

Install dev dependencies and run the full test suite before submitting:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest tests/
```

- Unit tests are required for all new mock classes and public methods
- Tests must pass for all layers: `pytest tests/` runs all three
- Device layer tests must pass with no external runtime dependencies (no paho-mqtt, no flask, no network)
